# Hi! ðŸ‘‹


Iâ€™m Sumeya Sayd, a recent Computer Science graduate with a strong passion for data management, cloud integration, and software testing. My journey in tech has been driven by a deep interest in harnessing the power of programming and testing to ensure the reliability and security of software systems, and Iâ€™m eager to expand my knowledge in cloud security and test engineering.

Iâ€™m particularly fascinated by how thorough testing can enhance software quality, prevent issues before they reach users, and contribute to overall system stability. My experience working with tools like Python, PowerBI, and AWS has equipped me with the skills to tackle complex projects, from designing cloud-integrated systems to ensuring their robustness through effective testing strategies.

Currently, Iâ€™m immersing myself in advanced cloud technologies and continuously refining my skills in software development and test engineering. Iâ€™m always on the lookout for opportunities to collaborate on exciting projects that push the boundaries of what technology can achieve. If youâ€™re working on something interesting in the areas of cloud security, software testing, or system automation, Iâ€™d love to connect!

If you'd like to reach out, please find me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sumeyasayd/) to connect.
